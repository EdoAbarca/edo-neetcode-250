**Category:** Linked List

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Approach

### Thought Process

Another data structure seen in my college days. At least the single linked list (there are more versions, like double or cyclical) consists of nodes, a custom data type that contains:

- Value: The value hold by the node, usually integer
- Next: Pointer to the next node

Now, about the problem itself: The goal is reversing a singly linked list so that the head becomes the tail and all `next` pointers are flipped. How do we achieve that? Let's take the second example:
1 (head) -> 2 -> null
Should become:
null <- 1 <- 2 (head)

It can be done in 2 ways:

1. Iterative: Traverse the list, flipping each nodeâ€™s next pointer.
2. Recursive: Dive deep recursively, then reverse the pointers as the stack unwinds.



### Strategy Used

I chose the iterative approach for better step-by-step understanding and debugging. While recursion is elegant, iteration feels more intuitive in this case.

Pointers used:

- prev: keeps track of the reversed list so far
- curr: current node being processed
- next: temporarily stores the next node to avoid losing reference

As a loop through the whole list is needed, O(n) time will be achieved. However, as single variables will be used to traverse the list, O(1) space will be achieved.

## Results
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Time execution
- **Time spent:** 0ms (100.00%)
- **Memory used:** 57.58 mb (49.62%)

## Notes / Learnings
- Follow-up achieved, look at the .js file for both solutions
- Notes of the recursive results shall be added for comparision and conclusion purposes
- Nice metrics from the iterative approach. Will the recursive version be better (or worser)?
