# My Neetcode 250 Solutions

## Introduction

Hello! I'm currently preparing for upcoming technical interviews. Since I've struggled with solving Leetcode problems in the past, I decided to follow the Neetcode 250 program to build a strong foundation. This set of carefully crafted problems will help me understand common patterns, improve my problem-solving skills, and build momentum to ace interviews — and potentially optimize how I approach coding in my projects.

## Context

The **Neetcode 250** is a curated list of 250 Leetcode problems, organized by category and increasing difficulty. It's designed to provide a structured learning path by focusing on key problem-solving patterns commonly asked in interviews. You can access it here: https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode250

## Structure

The repository is organized by problem pattern. Each top-level folder represents a pattern and contains subfolders for individual problems:

```
[Number]-[PatternName]/
    └── [Number].[ProblemName]/
                ├── problem-name.py   # Python solution (TBA if not ready)
                ├── problem-name.js   # JavaScript solution
                └── problem-name.md   # Problem description, constraints, thought process, results, and notes
```
