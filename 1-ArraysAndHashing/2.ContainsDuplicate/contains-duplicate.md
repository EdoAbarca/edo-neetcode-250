## Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true

Explanation:

The element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: true

 

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
